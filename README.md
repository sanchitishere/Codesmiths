Our code creates a "MediVault" web application designed to store and access medical emergency profiles. Here's a brief overview:

The application has two main interfaces:
1. **Authentication Page** with login and registration functionality
2. **Dashboard** that displays the user's medical information

Key features include:
- User registration with personal details
- Medical information storage (blood type, allergies, chronic conditions)
- Emergency contacts management
- Medication/prescription tracking
- An SOS emergency button for quick access to help
- QR code scanning functionality to import medical data
- Local storage for data persistence between sessions

The interface is clean and responsive with a blue color scheme, card-based layouts, and animated SOS buttons. Data is stored locally using the browser's localStorage API, with a demo user pre-populated for testing purposes.
The application includes modals for emergency situations and QR code scanning, with appropriate security measures for user authentication. It's designed to be user-friendly while providing quick access to critical medical information during emergencies.
